        Welcome to Hydra Ecosystemâ€™s ideas page for GSoC 2020. We would like to receive proposals
        that encompass different aspects of the development. Different tools are under development
        and candidates can present projects to fulfill multiple ideas on this page and issues listed
        at our Github organization page.
        Application Instructions
Students wanting to apply to the org must familarise themselves with the Github workflow.
Working on open issues is the best way for your skill to be recognised.
It is a good practice to search the history of issues for similar problems before creating a new issue on GitHub,
        this will avoid the creation of duplicated issues.
